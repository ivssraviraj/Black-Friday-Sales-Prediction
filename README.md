# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
A lot of business happens during the Black Friday sales. Due to the substantial number of people
who shop, business organizations might not be able to provide the same service to all customers,
irrespective of their spending. To be more profitable, businesses should be able to target the
customers who spend more. Our approaches compare various regression models on previous
customer spending habits and draw conclusions about future customers&#39; spending. We start by
taking the dataset and pre-processing it to remove unwanted dependencies on the target variable
and then apply various regression algorithms on the dataset to draw conclusions like the details
of the customers who are likely to spend more on Black Friday
